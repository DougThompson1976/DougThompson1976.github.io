In 1983:

- My dad bought an Apple II computer to automate his business with spreadsheets...

- I automated my math homework with BASIC

- I learned that Army automated the H-Bomb with an artillery arithmetic machine

In 1984:
- I read 1984

- The SuperBowl had the Apple "1984 Ad"

- My dad took me to the Macintosh introduciton with Steve Jobs.

Now I am combining them all:

- BASIC

- Spreadsheets

- Symbolic calculation (what Einstein needed for the H-Bomb) 

    To automate my life...
